To achieve the goal of the project, at the start of the work i used lineplot to represent the sales of every region in the last 16 years based on feature called "Year_of_Release".

the figure shows the Sales of each region as it follows:

1- the North America in <font color=blue>"Blue"</font> line

2- the Europe in <font color=orange>"orange"</font> dashes

3- the Japan in <font color=green>"green"</font> dots

4- the other sales in <font color=red>"red"</font> dots and dashes


the result indcates that<font color=blue> North America</font> region is the most profitable region specially between the year 2006 to 2010 as it starts to downgrade in the last few years



Follows it in the second place <font color=orange>"Europe"</font> as it is the second most region in term of sales,<font color=orange>"Europe"</font> region has not changed much compared with<font color=blue> North America</font> region



<font color=green>"Japan"</font> region takes the third place in Sales,in the last 4 years the region decreased significantlly as<font color=red> other sales</font>  became above <font color=green>"Japan"</font> region in terms of sales
